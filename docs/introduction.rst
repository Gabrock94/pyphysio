Introduction
============

pyphysio is a library of state of art algorithms for the analysis of physiological signals. It contains the implementations of the most important algorithms for the analysis of physiological data like ECG, BVP, EDA and inertial. The 
algorithms are implemented on top of a framework that provides caching to optimize feature extraction pipelines.
